In this lab we are giving the Netduino a unique device identifier.  

Give your device a network unique name such as your such as your email address

Leave all code from the previous lab in place and only modify the StartNetworkServices Line and add
the additional device identifier parameter


StartNetworkServices("your device name", true, "your device identifier goes here");
